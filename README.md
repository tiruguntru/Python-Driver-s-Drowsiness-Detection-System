# Project:Driver Drowsiness Detection System



First of all title of the project is driver drowsiness detection system 
          
* now a days car accidents have been reported that were caused by distracted drivers

* our aim is to improve the performence of detecting driver's distracted actions

* when the model running in the server identifies that the driver is drowsy then it will inform the alarm to ring in the vehicle dash board

* then it starts identifying the driver's eyes again if it identifies whether the driver is still drowsy or not...if no drowsy alarm is set off again
  
* so this project is done by using python

## MODULES
- [x] OPEN CV(COMPUTER VISION)
this library is used to detect a driver with small eyes with screen

- [x] KERAS
keras is an open source deep learning framework for python

- [x] TENSOR FLOW
it is an open source machine learning frame work for python

- [x] pyganme
pygame is a set of python modules 
this module is used to play the alarm sound 


## REQUIREMENTS
<kbd>→</kbd>  OS.....Program is tested on windows 10

<kbd>→</kbd>  LAPTOP...used to run the our code 

<kbd>→</kbd>  WEBCAM....Used to get the video feed(capture the images)


## TECHNOLOGIES USED:
- [x] PYTHON
- [x] MACHINE LEARNING
- [x] DEEP LEARNING

by using machine learning i trained the images helf of convolutional neural networks
by the  deep learning the device is reacted by the trained images 
so by matching of trained images to device automatically alarm turn on and alerts the driver


## output
 > Here is the ouput of the above project :-
